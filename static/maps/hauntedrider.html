This one of cu's favorites. The map starts out in a castle. After starting checkpoints lead racers out of the fortress past the some giant skeletal bones, then under a guy that has hanged himself above the cliff, past 10 or so explosive traps, and finally to a beach front. Yet, the checkpoints then lead up a track into the sky where you see a giant hand reaching over and onto where you are trying to ride. If you have made it this far, the track loops back around the outside next to the canyon wall, which leads into a jump headed right into the mouth of a parasite looking creator swimming right out of the water. After entering ... a teleportal sends you back to the castle's crypts which completes 1 lap.
